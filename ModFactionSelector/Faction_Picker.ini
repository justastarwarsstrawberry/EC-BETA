description:  With the use of EDeN's technology, humanity has sucessfully \ncreated the first spacetime rift in it's history! Unfortunately, to everyone's surprise the rift actually connected to a \ndifferent universe... that owned the faction known as ColCon. \nA hivemind of human cyborgs with robotic parts that come from a dystopian earth. \nThey have entered our world for search of resources, and do not seem \nto be keen on helping us with our naive wars over small land... \n  - Extreme skill in robot production allows them to mass-produce robot soldiers more effective than the average human soldier. \n- This makes them a swarm-based faction. \n -Lack variation in unit types due to only having mass-producable robot soldiers. \nStrong, singular-unit type units can raze their numbers with ease.
